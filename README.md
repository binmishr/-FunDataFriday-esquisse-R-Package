 WHAT IS IT?

An R package which creates easy ggplot charts through a drag and drop interface. You can use the pop up UI to create your perfect plot and then export the results as .png, .jpg or export the code!


WHY IS IT AWESOME?

    Fast EDA – While ggplot is very fast and easy to use, if you are looking to visually explore your data at all angles with a variety of straight forward plot types, filters, groupings etc, this is your fastest path.

    Gaining familiarity with ggplot – With this package you can rapidly make a graph, look at the code, make a change, see how that impacted the code and repeat!
